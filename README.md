# AUXILIUM Mission
Here to help! The Auxilium App is an app focused on finding handicap accessibility features in real time.
We are a team of students who are committed to making grounds inclusive and welcoming!

Handicap access should be a basic feature of every building, and in an effort to not only improve these, we want to make finding these extremely easy as it should be.
# It's a Community!
We need your help!

Users for Use: For those looking for handicap access features on grounds, here's what you do:

As an aside: if you notice areas on grounds that are extremely limited with their handicap access, let us know that too! We want to make grounds inclusive and better for everyone who traverses it - here's how to notify us of this:
