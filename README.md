# AUXILIUM Mission :muscle:
Here to help! The Auxilium App is an app focused on finding handicap accessibility ammenities in real time.  (add description of stuff)
# It's a Community!
The Auxilium App will rely on it's users to build the database. As the users go around and use the app, if they notice an ammenity not on the app, they can add it on! 
# How the App looks
